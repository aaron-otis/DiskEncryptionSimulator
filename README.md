## Disk Encryption Simulator

A disk encryption simulator with simple LUKS implementation created for an academic lab. This project should not be considered secure and should not be used to secure *anything*!

### Issues
* XEX is incorrectly implemented.
* C style return values should be replaced with exceptions.
* Currently only supports one key slot.
